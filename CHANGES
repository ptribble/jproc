Update jmdns to 3.6.2

Drop apache httpclient, now we're based on minimum java 11 the native one
http client is perfectly adequate

Switch to openjson https://github.com/openjson/openjson which has a much
clearer license

Update HttpClient to 5.5

Migrate to Apache HttpClient 5 (classic mode)

Add option to build a RESTful service using Jersey

Update the JSON jar (from https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java)

Added jmdns and slf4j-api to support mdns

Added mdns registration to the server, enabled by the -m argument

PMD is now version 7 (and very noisy)

Enable SpotBugs (also very noisy)

1.5

General tidying

Update HttpClient to 4.5.14

1.4

Enable running under jdk11

1.0

NOTE: Post version 1.0, new features will appear in v2.0 and later
which will require a minimum Java 7

Update httpclient to 4.2.3

Remove Play sample

Build packages

Add man page

Add SMF manifest to run server

0.12

Update license details

Refactor the table models

0.11

Tweak popup code

Play server implementation

RESTful client implementation

Start time only shows date for processes over 24 hours old, not 1 hour

Remove auth from PServerConfig as the embedded server doesn't support
it.

Expose project lookups by name/id.

New zoneinfo subcommand, showing aggregate usage by zone

NativeJProc.getProcesses() checks the process still exists before
adding it.

Remove RemoteJProc, functionality incorporated directly into JProc.

JProc getUserName() and friends returns the uid as a String if there's
no matching user, rather than null.

0.10

Fixed process exit handling in LWPUsageTableModel

New ProcessExitedTableModel which ProcessTable and LWPUsageTable now
show if the process they're displaying exits.

PSusageTableModel handles process exit correctly (NPE if it needed to
redraw a cell before the next update that actually removed the process
from the table)

Update Jingle

New userinfo subcommand, showing aggregate usage by user

0.9

Add JSON output and JSON parser

Add server and client

Add XML-RPC jars, json jar

jmx code actually works (not necessarily useful, but not actually
broken)

PTree no longer gives NPE if given invalid pid

Added README.SERVER and 'build war'

0.8

Preliminary JMX support

Add filtering by task, project, and process contract to JProcessFilter.

Clean up matchFilter()

JProcessSet gains getTasks() and getProjects(). These return a Set of
numeric ids, without being converted

Java 7 compatibility: don't instantiate JProcResources

Java 7 compatibility: fix getColumnClass()

Remove unnecessary no-argument constructors

0.7

Updated jumble to 1.4

Significant refactoring - all information now retrieved via
JProc. NativeJProc extends the abstract class ProcessInterface. This
will allow remote interfaces to be added later, which was impossible
with the old design.

Thread popups now show the right process if the table has been sorted.

ProcessTreeNode has getProcess(), so use it.

JProcessFilter can represent a single process.

Harmonize order of constructor arguments

JPinfoPanel, JPusagePanel, and LWPusagePanel directly extend
JTable. And class names changed to reflect that.

JPTree shows process info as well as thread information

Correct the help (especially for jptree)

Create a NoSuchProcessException class.

Moved the ActionListener from the model to the enclosing table.

Clean javadoc

0.6

Add pmd checks migrating,strictexception,braces

Remove unnecessary static initialization blocks

Updated jumble to 1.3

Clean up ProcessTreeNode

@author annotation

JProcUsage needs to be implemented

info - hide zone column if there's only one

Add tables for process and lwp usage

New usage subcommand, showing the usage tables

Fix exception generated when setting a custom renderer on a column
that's not visible

Move panel classes from demo to gui

jptree updates the tree as processes come and go

On usage and info tables right-click gives you a menu that shows a
thread activity table in a new window.

ps subcommand removed - it was mostly for initial debugging

0.5

Updated jingle and jumble.

pmd target in build script

Fix some typos in the help files

JProcStatus also simply return times as doubles, rather than the
seconds/nanoseconds parts

Remove JProcLwpUsage - it's functionally identical to JProcUsage, with
the same structure underneath.

Fix JLwp.equals()

Actually close anything we open in native code; we had a massive file
descriptor leak

Just open a File on /proc once in JProc

Remove the windows and client/server stuff inherited from jkstat

Neater display of time used

jpinfo can now hide and show columns as the user chooses; new Column menu

0.4

pmd cleanup

No more Jtop - Jps is a superset

No more Vector

ptree subcommand - with no arguments or a single pid

Humanize memory, start and elapsed times in jpinfo (using
CellRenderers, so the tables still sort correctly on the underlying
data)

64-bit, needed so that 64-bit processes can be shown

Added pr_ctime from psinfo_t

Remove access to the individual seconds/nanoseconds parts of time and
ctime.

0.3

classes properly public

0.2

Cleaned up javadoc

Native lookup of user, group, zone, project names and ids

JProcessSet, allows process tracking

JProcessFilter, allows process filtering by user or zone

JPinfo now does filtering by user or zone

0.1

Initial version
