Things to do, and problems to solve.

kar-like archive and parser "par"

JPtree - process tree; funky graphics. (Can expand etc like a tree;
show contract and zone transitions; show user transitions; show
aggregated usage.)

Table sort is lost when structure changes.

Generalize jptree and ptree to handle the case where there isn't a
single root to the tree

Top lookalike - sort on anything, filter on anything, display anything,
choose what fields to display; dynamically expand process into LWPs
like a tree. Really belongs in solview, which brings multiple bits
together

JsonJproc should catch IOException explicitly as that's what
client.execute() throws (need to test to see exactly what comes back)

Shame zoneinfo (and userinfo) don't show rates, especially in the form
of %cpu - that would be very useful.
