JProc - a java jni interface to Solaris/illumos process information
using the procfs filesystem.


http://www.petertribble.co.uk/Solaris/jproc.html


The primary demo is

./jproc info

which gives a very simplistic gui table view, somewhat like top or
prstat.

To see what subcommands are available, just type ./jproc without any
arguments.

If you have any problems, suggestions for ways in which JProc can be
improved, or new uses to which it can be put, or interesting ways in
which processes can be visualized, let me know.
